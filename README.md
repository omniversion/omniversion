## Dependency management toolbox

`omniversion` simplifies dependency management in complex projects by streamlining common tasks:

### Collection
[omniversion/ansible](ansible) collects versions and dependencies from servers orchestrated via Ansible.

### Aggregation
[omniversion/cli](cli) translates the output of many different version managers into a single, coherent list.

### Analysis
[omniversion/python](python) adds convenience methods to create dashboards and reports in a few lines of code.

## Why?

Maintaining a code base with a 

* Every self-respecting programming language has its own package manager, for some reason.
* Package managers differ greatly in their syntax, features, terminology and underlying model.
* Many versions are not actually controlled by package managers. More often than not, this includes the package manager itself.
* Versions checked into source control 
* Running commands on remote servers is time-consuming and error-prone.
* 


## Quick start

Prerequisites: You should have Ansible, npm and Python installed.

1. Install the Ansible collection, the CLI and the Python module on your machine:
    ```shell
    ansible-galaxy collection install layer9gmbh.omniversion
    npm install -g omniversion
    pip install omniversion
    ```


2. Run the `all` Ansible playbook
    ```shell
    ansible-playbook layer9gmbh.omniversion.all
    ```
    in a directory where Ansible can find your host definitions.


3. Run the Python sample dashboard:
    ```shell
    python3 -m omniversion.samples.dashboard
    ```
