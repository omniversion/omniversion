including existing installations, security advisories and all sorts of other metadata.

If multiple versions of the same package need to be tracked
for a single combination of package manager and host,
this should be done using a single PackageMetadata structure.
By contrast, otherwise identical packages made available by different package managers
are considered different, as their metadata and/or content *may* indeed differ.
We also distinguish between package metadata on different hosts,
as installations are different and available versions
will depend on the configured repositories, firewall settings etc.
